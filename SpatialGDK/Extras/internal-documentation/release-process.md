# GDK for Unreal Release Process

This document outlines the process for releasing a version of the GDK for Unreal and all associated projects.

> This process will need to be reviewed once we hit beta.

## Terminology
* **Release version** is the version of the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal that you are releasing by performing the steps in this document.
* **Previous version** is the latest version of the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal that is currently released to customers. You can find out what this version is [here](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/releases).
* `<GameRoot>` - The directory that contains your projectâ€™s .uproject file and Source folder.
* `<ProjectRoot>` - The directory that contains your `<GameRoot>` directory.
* `<YourProject>` - The name of your project and .uproject file (for example, `\<GameRoot>\YourProject.uproject`).

## Validation pre-requisites

The following entry criteria must be met before you start the validation steps:

### Ensure Xbox DLLs exist

To check that Xbox-compatible Worker SDK DLLs are available.

1. Identify the Worker SDK version pinned by the GDK. To do this, check [core-sdk.version](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/blob/master/SpatialGDK/Extras/core-sdk.version) on `master`.
1. Identify the XDK version(s) officially supported in all UE4 versions that the GDK version you're about to release supports. To do this:
    1. Google search for the release notes for all UE4 versions that the GDK version you're about to release supports (for example [4.22 Release Notes](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Support/Builds/ReleaseNotes/4_22/index.html))
    1. Search in page (ctrl-f) for `XDK` and note down the supported version (for example, the [4.22 Release Notes](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Support/Builds/ReleaseNotes/4_22/index.html) reveals that it supports `XDK: July 2018 QFE-4`).
    1. Convert `XDK: July 2018 QFE-4` to the format that `spatial package get` expects. This is **year** **month** **QFE Version**. For example `XDK: July 2018 QFE-4` converts to `180704`.
    1. Using the information you just ascertained, fill in the `<...>` blanks in the below command and run it via command line:<br>
`spatial package get worker_sdk c-dynamic-x86_64-<XDK version>-xbone <SDK version> c-sdk-<SDK version>.zip`<br>
A correct command looks something like this:<br>
`spatial package get worker_sdk c-dynamic-x86_64-xdk180401-xbone 13.7.1 c-sdk-13.7.1-180401.zip`<br>
If it succeeds it will download a DLL.<br>
If it fails because the DLL is not available, file a WRK ticket for the Worker team to generate the required DLL(s). See [WRK-1275](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/WRK-1275) for an example.

### Create the `UnrealGDK` release candidate
1. Notify `#dev-unreal-internal` that you intend to commence a release. Ask if anyone `@here` knows of any blocking defects in code or docs that should be resolved prior to commencement of the release process.
1. `git clone` the [UnrealGDK](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK).
1. `git checkout master`
1. `git pull`
1. Using `git log`, take note of the latest commit hash.
1. `git checkout -b x.y.z-rc` in order to create release candidate branch.
1. Open `CHANGELOG.md`, which is in the root of the repository.
1. Read **every** release note in the `Unreleased` section. Ensure that they make sense, they conform to [how-to-write-good-release-notes.md](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/blob/master/SpatialGDK/Extras/internal-documentation/how-to-write-good-release-notes.md) structure.
1. Compare `master` to `release` using the GitHub UI and ensure that every change that requires a release note has one.
1. Enter the release version and planned date of release in a `##` block. Move the `Unreleased` section above this.
    - Look at the previous release versions in the changelog to see how this should be done.
1. Commit your changes to `CHANGELOG.md`.
1. Open `SpatialGDK/SpatialGDK.uplugin`.
1. Increment the `VersionName` and `Version`.
1. Commit your changes to `SpatialGDK/SpatialGDK.uplugin`.
1. `git push --set-upstream origin x.y.z-rc` to push the branch.
1. Announce the branch and the commit hash it uses in the `#unreal-gdk-release` channel.

### Create the `improbableio/UnrealEngine` release candidate
1. `git clone` the [improbableio/UnrealEngine](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine).
1. `git checkout 4.xx-SpatialOSUnrealGDK`
1. `git pull`
1. Using `git log`, take note of the latest commit hash.
1. `git checkout -b 4.xx-SpatialOSUnrealGDK-x.y.z-rc` in order to create release candidate branch.
1. `git push --set-upstream origin 4.xx-SpatialOSUnrealGDK-x.y.z-rc` to push the branch.
1. Repeat the above steps for all supported `4.xx` engine versions.
1. Announce the branch and the commit hash it uses in the `#unreal-gdk-release` channel.

### Create the `UnrealGDKExampleProject` release candidate
1. `git clone` the [UnrealGDKExampleProject](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject).
1. `git checkout master`
1. `git pull`
1. Using `git log`, take note of the latest commit hash.
1. `git checkout -b x.y.z-rc` in order to create release candidate branch.
1. `git push --set-upstream origin x.y.z-rc` to push the branch.
1. Announce the branch and the commit hash it uses in the #unreal-gdk-release channel.

### Serve docs locally
It is vital that you test using the docs for the release version that you are about to publish, not with the currently live docs that relate to the previous version.
1. cd `UnrealGDK`
1. git checkout `docs-release`
1. `improbadoc serve <path to x.y.z-rc-x docs>`

## Build your release candidate engine
1. Open http://localhost:8080/reference/1.0/content/get-started/dependencies.
1. Uninstall all dependencies listed on this page so that you can accurately validate our installation steps.
1. If you have one, delete your local clone of `UnrealEngine`.
1. Follow the installation steps on http://localhost:8080/reference/1.0/content/get-started/dependencies.
1. When you clone the `UnrealEngine`, be sure to checkout `x.y.z-rc-x` so you're building the release version.

## Implementing fixes

If at any point in the below validation steps you encounter a blocker, you must fix that defect prior to releasing.

The workflow for this is:

1. Raise a bug ticket in JIRA detailing the blocker.
1. `git checkout x.y.z-rc`
1. `git pull`
1. `git checkout -b bugfix/UNR-xxx`
1. Fix the defect.
1. `git commit`, `git push -u origin HEAD`, target your PR at `x.y.z-rc`.
1. When the PR is merged, `git checkout x.y.z-rc`, `git pull` and re-test the defect to ensure you fixed it.
1. Notify #unreal-gdk-release that the release candidate has been updated.
1. **Judgment call**: If the fix was isolated, continue the validation steps from where you left off. If the fix was significant, restart testing from scratch. Consult the rest of the team if you are unsure which to choose.

## Validation (GDK Starter Template)
1. Follow these steps: http://localhost:8080/reference/1.0/content/get-started/gdk-template, bearing in mind the following caveat:
* When you clone the GDK into the `Plugins` folder, be sure to checkout the release candidate branch, so you're working with the release version.
2. Launch a local SpatialOS deployment, then a standalone server-worker, and then connect two standalone clients to it. To do this:
* In your file browser, click `LaunchSpatial.bat` in order to run it.
* In your file browser, click `LaunchServer.bat` in order to run it.
* In your file browser, click `LaunchClient.bat` in order to run it.
* Run the same script again in order to launch the second client
* Run and shoot eachother with the clients as a smoke test.
* Open the `UE4 Console` and enter the command `open 127.0.0.1`. The desired effect is that the client disconnect and then re-connects to the map. If you can continue to play after executing the command then you've succesfully tested client travel.

3. Launch a local SpatialOS deployment, then connect two machines as clients using your local network. To do this:
* Ensure that both machines are on the same network.
* On your own machine, in your terminal, `cd` to `<ProjectRoot>`.
* Build out a windows client by running:
`Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat YourProject Win64 Development YourProject.uproject`
* Send the client you just built to the other machine you'll be using to connect. You can find it at: `\spatial\build\assembly\worker\UnrealClient@Windows.zip`
* Still on your server machine, discover your local IP address by runing `ipconfig`. It's the one entitled `IPv4 Address`.
* Still in your server machine, in a terminal window, `cd` to `<ProjectRoot>\spatial\` and run the following command: `spatial local launch default_launch.json --runtime_ip=<your local IP address>`
* Still on your server machine, run `LaunchServer.bat`.
* On the machine you're going to run your clients on, unzip `UnrealClient@Windows.zip`.
* On the machine you're going to run your clients on, in a terminal window, `cd` to the unzipped `UnrealClient@Windows` direcory and run the following command: `_YourProject.exe <local IP address of server machine> -workerType UnrealClient -useExternalIpForBridge true`
* Repeat the above step in order to launch the second client
* Run and shoot eachother with the clients as a smoke test.
* You can now turn off the machine that's running the client, and return to your own machine.

## Validation (UnrealGDKExampleProject)
1. Follow these steps: http://localhost:8080/reference/1.0/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro. All tests must pass.

## Validation (Playtest)
1. Follow these steps: https://brevi.link/unreal-release-playtests. All tests must pass.

## Validation (Docs)
1. Upload docs to docs-testing using Improbadoc.
1. Validate that Improbadoc reports no linting errors.
1. Read the docs for five minutes to ensure nothing looks broken.

## Release

All of the above tests **must** have passed and there must be no outstanding blocking issues before you start this, the release phase.

The order of `git merge` operations in all UnrealGDK related repositories is:<br>
`release candidate` > `preview` > `release` > `master`

If you want to soak test this release on the `preview` branch before promoting it to the `release` branch, only execute the steps that merge into `preview` and `master`.

1. When merging the following PRs, you need to enable `Allow merge commits` option on the repos and choose `Create a merge commit` from the dropdown in the pull request UI to merge the branch, then disable `Allow merge commits` option on the repos once the release process is complete. You need to be an admin to perform this.
